<summary>Entry - Sat Mar 29 2025</summary>

    <p>6:35 pm</p>

    <p>I'm making this journal to place my thoughts somewhere in the big sea of the internet. A couple months ago I thought I was going to post on Substack. I found the interface clunky and I think I put a bit too much pressure on myself. This site is great because nobody is reading. Unless you are, in which case, I give you a virtual kiss.</p>

    <p>I've been feeling and thinking a lot about writing, words, grammar, and ownership (if we can even determine it) over those three things. I consider myself somewhat of a grammar stickler, in the sense that when I observe a grammar mistake that was clearly made out of a lack of care, I sometimes snicker to myself and delight in the small misfortune of somebody else's mistake. There's that one episode of Sex and The City, where Carrie receives a thank-you card from Natasha, Big's new wife, where she has mispelled "There" as "Their." Carrie gleefully relays to Miranda that Natasha is "an idiot."</p>
    
    <p>However, there are times when I enjoy, and support a grammatical error. For one, I think pure lack of knowledge of a grammatical rule can make a mistake more endearing. I also think grammar can be broken purposefully for effect. My friends and I (not "my friends and me") have, for a while, participated in a ritualistic dropping of prepositional phrases. For example, instead of "can we go see that movie tonight?" we may say something like "we go movie tonight?" All's to say, I have imperfect and hyper-subjective rules around grammatical accuracy.</p>
    
    <p>I am going to make an effort to try and not self-check my grammar as much when writing and uploading to this journal. I still don't have a full grasp on how these writings will differ from the journal entries that I hamfistedly write in my (physical) journal, which I write typically when I'm in the heat of the moment or when I feel like I need to clear some ideas out of my head, like how one would sniffle-and-swallow when they must free a collection of snot from the top-back of their combined throat-nose pathway. I'm also going to try and only proofread one or two times, a luxury that my handwritten entries are never afforded.</p>
    
    <p>Okay.</p>

<summary>Backlog - Sat Mar 29 2025</summary>

    <p>5:30 pm</p>

    <p>I'm sitting on the back deck, on my Walmart sun chair. There's a slight chill in the 75 degree air, enough for me to put my socks back on. I can't be as naked as I wanted to (shirtless, that is). But I'm sitting outside because it's warm, and because I wanted to soak up the sitting-outside-possibility before it leaves for the next week (according to the weather forecast for the next ~5 days). I also wanted to feel like I was making the day useful, since I bailed on some familial responsibilities. I had good reason: sickness. Although I probably would've been fine if I went. But who knows. I'm sure this restful day is good for me. There's a lot on my mind and a lot of twisted-up discomfort in my body. I feel like I'm disappointing so many people. Here is a non-exhaustive list:</p>

    <p>- My classmates. Because I've put myself in this leadership position when I don't actually have the altruistic experience or disposition to be a perfectly democratic leader. And everyone in my program (including me) is incredibly gossip-y, so I can only imagine what is being said about me behind closed doors.</p>
    
    <p>- My family. For bailing on the events I was supposed to go to today. It's just like in grade school when I would be sick and I'd have to choose if I was well enough to go in or not. And I never wanted to miss class. I think its another consequence of having an extremely gentle parent. I had to choose for myself so often. Sometimes I just want the universe to choose for me. Because then I would be free from the consequences of my actions.</p>
    
    <p>- Myself? I guess? For not doing what I really want to do? I don't know. I need to get out of the realm of possibility. I need to turn more to the kinetic. And make my thoughts a reality in a much quicker and reliable process.</p>
    
    <p>Right now it feels like entire days go by in 30 minutes. I want more time. So I can catch up. Usually that's a sign of depression for me. I think I've just been cooped up. I can't believe I have fucking work on Monday.</p>
    
    <p>All this frustration is so self-indulgent. How can I stop viewing myself? And just live? I know self-awareness is a key asset I have. But when is it to my detriment?</p>
